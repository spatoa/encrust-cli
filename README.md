# encrust

**A local encrypt/decrypt tool for files using AES or ChaCha.**

The goal of this project is to create a CLI tool that can be used to encrypt and decrypt files of any size with speed using custom or generated keys. It will be later used as a backend for another GUI program written in Rust.
